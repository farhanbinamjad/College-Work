;; --------------------------------------------------------------------------


Problem 1 asks for a structurally recursive function, as a way
to begin familiarizing ourselves with Racket vectors. It is pretty
straightforward. Problems 2-5 ask you to implement a new list ADT
that compresses data. Problems 2-3 are straightforward. So is Problem
5 -- after you've solved Problem 4, which is the biggest challenge on the assignment.
complexity comes mostly from the fact that there are four cases to consider.
Think about them one by one, and use examples to help you design your code. Ask any questions you have!
